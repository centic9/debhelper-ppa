=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_compress> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [B<-X>I<item>] [B<-A>] [S<I<file ...>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_compress is a debhelper program that is responsible for compressing
the files in package build directories, and makes sure that any symlinks
that pointed to the files before they were compressed are updated to point
to the new files.

By default, dh_compress compresses files that debian policy mandates should
be compressed, namely all files in usr/share/info, usr/share/man,
files in usr/share/doc that are larger than 4k in size,
(except the copyright file, .html and .css files, image files, and files
that appear to be already compressed based on their extensions), and all
changelog files. Plus PCF fonts underneath usr/share/fonts/X11/

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item debian/I<package>.compress

If this file exists, the default files are not compressed. Instead, the
file is ran as a shell script, and all filenames that the shell script
outputs will be compressed. The shell script will be run from inside the
package build directory. Note though that using -X is a much better idea in
general; you should only use a debian/package.compress file if you really
need to.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-X>I<item>, B<--exclude=>I<item>

Exclude files that contain "item" anywhere in their filename from being
compressed. For example, -X.tiff will exclude tiff files from compression.
You may use this option multiple times to build up a list of things to
exclude. You can accomplish the same thing by using a debian/compress file,
but this is easier.

=item B<-A>, B<--all>

Compress all files specified by command line parameters in ALL packages
acted on.

=item I<file ...>

Add these files to the list of files to compress.
