B<dh_testdir> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [S<I<file> ...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_testdir> tries to make sure that you are in the correct directory when
building a Debian package. It makes sure that the file F<debian/control>
exists, as well as any other files you specify. If not,
it exits with an error.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item I<file> ...

Test for the existence of these files too.

# This command is completely useless when called from dh(1) as dh will
# have attempted to read d/control before it even constructs the
# command sequences.  Accordingly, there is no doubt that the
# following is unconditionally true:
#
# PROMISE: DH NOOP

# Run before init because init will try to read debian/control and
# we want a nicer error message.
checkfile('debian/control');

init();
inhibit_log();

foreach my $file (@ARGV) {
	checkfile($file);
}

sub checkfile {
	my $file=shift;
	if (! -e $file) {
		error("\"$file\" not found. Are you sure you are in the correct directory?");
	}
}
