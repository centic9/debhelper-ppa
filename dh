dh - debhelper command sequencer

=cut

use strict;
use Debian::Debhelper::Dh_Lib;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh> sequence [B<--with> I<addon>[,I<addon>,...]] [B<--list>] [B<--until> I<cmd>] [B<--before> I<cmd>] [B<--after> I<cmd>] [B<--remaining>] [S<I<debhelper options>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh runs a sequence of debhelper commands. The supported sequences
correspond to the targets of a debian/rules file: "build", "clean",
"install", "binary-arch", "binary-indep", and "binary".

Commands in the binary-indep sequence are passed the "-i" option to ensure
they only work on binary independent packages, and commands in the
binary-arch sequences are passed the "-a" option to ensure they only work
on architecture dependent packages.

Each debhelper command will record when it's successfully run in
debian/package.debhelper.log. (Which dh_clean deletes.) So dh can tell
which commands have already been run, for which packages, and skip running
those commands again.

Each time dh is run, it examines the log, and finds the last logged command
that is in the specified sequence. It then continues with the next command
in the sequence. The B<--until>, B<--before>, B<--after>, and B<--remaining>
options can override this behavior.

If debian/rules contains a target with a name like "override_I<dh_command>",
then when it would normally run I<dh_command>, dh will instead call that
target. The override target can then run the command with additional options,
or run entirely different commands instead. See examples below. (Note that to
use this feature, you should Build-Depend on debhelper 7.0.50 or above.)

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--with> I<addon>[,I<addon>,...]

Add the debhelper commands specified by the given addon to appropriate places
in the sequence of commands that is run. This option can be repeated more
than once, or multiple addons can be listed, separated by commas.
This is used when there is a third-party package that provides
debhelper commands. See the PROGRAMMING file for documentation about
the sequence addon interface.

=item B<--without> I<addon>

The inverse of --with, disables using the given addon.

=item B<--list>, B<-l>

List all available addons.

=item B<--until> I<cmd>

Run commands in the sequence until and including I<cmd>, then stop.

=item B<--before> I<cmd>

Run commands in the sequence before I<cmd>, then stop.

=item B<--after> I<cmd>

Run commands in the sequence that come after I<cmd>.

=item B<--remaining>

Run all commands in the sequence that have yet to be run.

=item B<--no-act>

Prints commands that would run for a given sequence, but does not run them.

=back

All other options passed to dh are passed on to each command it runs. This
can be used to set an option like "-v" or "-X" or "-N", as well as for more
specialised options.

In the above options, I<cmd> can be a full name of a debhelper command, or
a substring. It'll first search for a command in the sequence exactly
matching the name, to avoid any ambiguity. If there are multiple substring
matches, the last one in the sequence will be used.

=cut

sub command_pos {
	my $command=shift;
	my @sequence=@_;

	foreach my $i (0..$#sequence) {
		if ($command eq $sequence[$i]) {
			return $i;
		}
	}

	my @matches;
	foreach my $i (0..$#sequence) {
		if ($sequence[$i] =~ /\Q$command\E/) {
			push @matches, $i;
		}
	}
	if (! @matches) {
		error "command specification \"$command\" does not match any command in the sequence"
	}
	else {
		return pop @matches;
	}
}

=head1 EXAMPLES

To see what commands are included in a sequence, without actually doing
anything:

	dh binary-arch --no-act

This is a very simple rules file, for packages where the default sequences of
commands work with no additional options.

	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@

Often you'll want to pass an option to a specific debhelper command. The
easy way to do with is by adding an override target for that command.
	
	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@

	override_dh_strip:
		dh_strip -Xfoo
		
	override_dh_installdocs:
		dh_installdocs README TODO

Sometimes the automated dh_auto_configure and dh_auto_build can't guess
what to do for a strange package. Here's how to avoid running either
and instead run your own commands.

	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@

	override_dh_auto_configure:
		./mondoconfig

	override_dh_auto_build:
		make universe-explode-in-delight

Another common case is wanting to do something manually before or
after a particular debhelper command is run.

	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@

	override_dh_fixperms:
		dh_fixperms
		chmod 4755 debian/foo/usr/bin/foo

If your package is a python package, dh will use dh_pysupport by
default. This is how to use dh_pycentral instead.

	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@ --with python-central

Here is how to force use of perl's Module::Build build system,
which can be necessary if debhelper wrongly detects that the package
uses MakeMaker.

	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@ --buildsystem=perl_build

To patch your package using quilt, you can tell dh to use quilt's dh
sequence addons like this:
	
	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@ --with quilt

Here is an example of overriding where the dh_auto_* commands find
the package's source, for a package where the source is located in a
subdirectory.

	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@ --sourcedirectory=src

And here is an example of how to tell the dh_auto_* commands to build
in a subdirectory, which will be removed on clean.

	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@ --builddirectory=build

Finally, here is a way to prevent dh from running several commands
that you don't want it to run, by defining empty override targets for each
command.

	#!/usr/bin/make -f
	%:
		dh $@
	
	# Commands not to run:
	override_dh_auto_test override_dh_compress override_dh_fixperms:

my @ARGV_orig=@ARGV;

# python-support is enabled by default, at least for now
# (and comes first so python-central loads later and can disable it).

		},
		"without=s" => sub {

		},
		"l" => \$dh{LIST},
		"list" => \$dh{LIST},
	},

	# Bundling does not work well since there are unknown options.
	bundling => 0,
