SUPPORT POLICY FOR DEBHELPER COMPAT LEVELS
==========================================

The current policy for supporting compat levels is:

 * A compat level may be deprecated once the latest oldoldstable release
   supports a /newer/ compat level.  (E.g. compat 9 can be deprecated once
   jessie becomes oldoldstable).

 * Alternatively, a compat level may be deprecated if a debhelper version
   supporting a newer compat level is backported to oldoldstable-backports/
   oldoldstable-backports-sloppy and the oldest supported Ubuntu LTS release.

 * These rules are independent of whether Debian oldoldstable is still
   supported.

 * Deprecated compat levels may be removed in unstable once it as been released
   in Debian stable as deprecated (provided that the deprecation has been
   announced at least one year prior to the freeze of said stable release).
