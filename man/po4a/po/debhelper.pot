msgid ""
"Debhelper is used to help you build a Debian package. The philosophy behind "
"debhelper is to provide a collection of small, simple, and easily understood "
"tools that are used in F<debian/rules> to automate various common aspects of "
"building a package. This means less work for you, the packager.  It also, to "
"some degree means that these tools can be changed if Debian policy changes, "
"and packages that use them will require only a rebuild to comply with the "
"new policy."

"A typical F<debian/rules> file that uses debhelper will call several "

"To create a new Debian package using debhelper, you can just copy one of the "

"automates the process. For a more gentle introduction, the B<maint-guide> "
