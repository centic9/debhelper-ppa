=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_makeshlibs> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [B<-m>I<major>] [B<-V>I<[dependencies]>] [B<-n>] [B<-X>I<item>] [S<B<--> I<params>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_makeshlibs> is a debhelper program that automatically scans for shared
libraries, and generates a shlibs file for the libraries it finds.

It also adds a call to ldconfig in the F<postinst> and F<postrm> scripts (in
v3 mode and above only) to any packages in which it finds shared libraries.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item debian/I<package>.shlibs

Installs this file, if present, into the package as DEBIAN/shlibs.  If
omitted, debhelper will generate a shlibs file automatically if it
detects any libraries.

Note in compat levels 9 and earlier, this file was installed by
L<dh_installdeb(1)> rather than B<dh_makeshlibs>.

=item debian/I<package>.symbols

=item debian/I<package>.symbols.I<arch>

These symbols files, if present, are passed to L<dpkg-gensymbols(1)> to
be processed and installed. Use the I<arch> specific names if you need
to provide different symbols files for different architectures.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-m>I<major>, B<--major=>I<major>

Instead of trying to guess the major number of the library with objdump,
use the major number specified after the -m parameter. This is much less
useful than it used to be, back in the bad old days when this program
looked at library filenames rather than using objdump.

=item B<-V>, B<-V>I<dependencies>

=item B<--version-info>, B<--version-info=>I<dependencies>

By default, the shlibs file generated by this program does not make packages
depend on any particular version of the package containing the shared
library. It may be necessary for you to add some version dependency
information to the shlibs file. If B<-V> is specified with no dependency
information, the current upstream version of the package is plugged into a
dependency that looks like "I<packagename> B<(E<gt>>= I<packageversion>B<)>". Note that in
debhelper compatibility levels before v4, the Debian part of the package
version number is also included. If B<-V> is specified with parameters, the
parameters can be used to specify the exact dependency information needed
(be sure to include the package name).

Beware of using B<-V> without any parameters; this is a conservative setting
that always ensures that other packages' shared library dependencies are at
least as tight as they need to be (unless your library is prone to changing
ABI without updating the upstream version number), so that if the
maintainer screws up then they won't break. The flip side is that packages
might end up with dependencies that are too tight and so find it harder to
be upgraded.

=item B<-n>, B<--noscripts>

Do not add the "ldconfig" trigger even if it seems like the package
might need it.  The option is called B<--noscripts> for historical
reasons as B<dh_makeshlibs> would previously generate maintainer
scripts that called B<ldconfig>.

=item B<-X>I<item>, B<--exclude=>I<item>

Exclude files that contain I<item> anywhere in their filename or directory 
from being treated as shared libraries.

=item B<--add-udeb=>I<udeb>

Create an additional line for udebs in the shlibs file and use I<udeb> as the
package name for udebs to depend on instead of the regular library package.

=item B<--> I<params>

Pass I<params> to L<dpkg-gensymbols(1)>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item B<dh_makeshlibs>

Assuming this is a package named F<libfoobar1>, generates a shlibs file that
looks something like:
 libfoobar 1 libfoobar1

=item B<dh_makeshlibs -V>

Assuming the current version of the package is 1.1-3, generates a shlibs
file that looks something like:
 libfoobar 1 libfoobar1 (>= 1.1)

=item B<dh_makeshlibs -V 'libfoobar1 (E<gt>= 1.0)'>

Generates a shlibs file that looks something like:
  libfoobar 1 libfoobar1 (>= 1.0)
